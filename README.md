# ALX HTML Intro Project

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is an introduction to HTML. The goal is to understand the structure of HTML documents and how web browsers interpret them. No external libraries or frameworks are used — just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task 0 - Basic Structure

Created a valid HTML5 document in `base_index.html` with a DOCTYPE, `<head>` (including `<title>`), and an empty `<body>`. The file passes W3C validation with no errors.

### Task 1 - Make a cool first webpage

Created `index.html` by copying from `base_index.html`. Added:

- Headings (h1, h2, h3)
- Four paragraphs of descriptive content
- Clickable ALX logo image linking to the ALX Africa website

### Task 2 - Make a cool other webpage

Created `tweets.html`:

- Embedded a real tweet using Twitter’s embed code
- Added navigation link to return to `index.html`

Also updated `index.html` with a link to `tweets.html` for easy navigation.
